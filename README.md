# kNN4Spark
#### PySpark Implementation for k Nearest-Neighbor Classification

Test the code: `spark-submit knn.py`

[knn_copy.py](https://github.com/zhiyzuo/kNN4Spark/blob/master/knn_copy.py) is just a copy of previous version (function). Since I rewrote the algorithm into a `class`, I saved the original file as a copy in case functions are better.

##### To do List:

* Instance Function test()
* Do you think we should also store the wrong pixels so that we can go back to see the "hard samples"?
